# Git 101 Skills Workshop

## Instructions for practice
* create a directory called git-101, cd into it and init your repo
* go to GitHub and create a repo. Usually you want to name it the same thing as your local project
* add the remote repo to your local repo and push up (rename main if you need to)
* cut a new branch called feature/html-css-button
* create index.html and styles.css files
* add the skeleton of an HTML document to the HTML file.
* add and commit your work
* add an H1 to your HTML, write a CSS rule to add a color to that H1
* add and commit your work
* add a paragraph under the H1, write a CSS rule to add a border to that paragraph
* add and commit your work
* check your git log
* add a button under your paragraph, write a CSS rule to add some padding to that button
* check your work - does it meet the criteria for the HTML and CSS Style Guides? If so, move on. If not, fix it.
* add, commit, and push up your work
* verify that all your code is now on the GitHub repo
* create a PR for your work, explaining what you did and how it should be tested (if necessary)
* have a teammate do a PR review and merge your PR
* look at your commit history on GitHub
* in your terminal, checkout main and pull down the repo
* check your editor - you should see work from your branch
* run through this with multiple teammates, multiple times, adding stuff as you go along (naming branches appropriately)

* cut a new branch and do some stuff, add and commit -- but don't push
* now cut a new branch from there
* do some stuff and stash it
* checkout main
* pull origin main
* checkout your second branch
* rebase
* now what???


## Other scenarios
* What if you had CI/CD on this project, requiring passing builds/deploys on every PR and merge?
* How would this be different based on whether you're using rebase or merge workflow?
